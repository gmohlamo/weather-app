# Weather-API
This application is going to be my attempt at making a daemon that will periodically query a weather API, fill a file and relay that information to my status bar.
I am currently using Xmobar and require the following:

# Currently
The application will print the current temperature and the real feel
These should make it into a piped output and then get rendered to the bar
